## PCA (Principle component analysis)
Basic features:
1. Unsupervised learning task - extract several principle components that capture most variance
2. Training data: a bunch of data points (x,y)
3. Given response pattern and scores for each dimension, find $k$ principle components, which are just linear combination of $\textbf{x}$.
4. The final results are $k$ elements, in another word, a matrix of loadings.

## Graded IRT model
Basic features:
1. Unsupervised learning task - assuming existence of several latent variables
2. Data: only response pattern of each item for each respondent
3. Given the response pattern and the graded IRT model, find the loadings for each latent variable.
4. The final results are a matrix of parameters.;
